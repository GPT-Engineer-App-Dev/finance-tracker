# finance-tracker

Implement a budgeting app with the following functionality:

1. A form for adding new transactions with fields for:
   - Date (date picker) 
   - Amount (number input)
   - Type (radio button for income/expense)
   - Category (dropdown with options like groceries, bills, salary, etc)
   - Add button to submit the form
2. Display a list of all transactions in a table showing date, amount, type, category for each
3. Add an edit button next to each transaction that opens the form populated with that transaction's details and allows updating it
4. Add a delete button next to each transaction to remove it
5. Store the transactions in state and update the table whenever a transaction is added, edited or deleted

For now, no need to implement filtering, balance calculation or exporting. We'll add those later. 
Focus on getting the core functionality of adding, editing, deleting and listing transactions working.
Feel free to pre-populate the app with some dummy transaction data.
